    <h1>Art Portfolio</h1>

    <p id="desc"> Here is a sample of some of my artwork. I have been drawing and improving on my art since the first grade, where I started out making comics with my friends. Since then, I have taken art classes all throughout grade school and for 4 semesters of high school. I have also worked with <a href="https://www.artworkscincinnati.org/"> ArtWorks Cincinnati</a> on the mural <a href="https://www.artworkscincinnati.org/mural/the-roots-of-walnut-hills/"> "The Roots of Walnut Hills"</a> as an apprentice.  I have received multiple awards and been in multiple art shows as well! </p>
    <p id="desc"> All images here are of my creation, photographing, and ownership. If these images are to be reposted in any way shape or form, <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
