    <p id="desc"> For starters, this website has been programmed by me using HTML and CSS, hosted by Replit. Some code basics and formatting have been forked from Girls Who Code, where I learned a fair amount of the skills used in the making of this website. For more information on them, you can go to <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">their website here</a>.</p>
    <p id="desc"> If you would like to see my progress throughout my journey in coding, feel free to check me out at <a href="https://replit.com/@ihages23">my Replit page</a></p>

      <img id="robot" src="assets/selfdrivingrobot.webp" alt="a LEGO robot. I nicknamed it Mr. Turtle :)" > 
      <p id="galtxt"> This is my self-driving car, which I have built and coded with LEGO Mindstorms through the University of Cincinnati's Foundations of Engineering and Design course. It uses ultrasound sensors to navigate, making sure to turn before running into a wall. Details can be found<a href="https://ihageman23.wixsite.com/engineering/self-driving-car">here</a></p>

    <li class="lgallery"> <img id="soonimg" src="assets/ADHFree.png" alt="A screenshot from the prototype page of the ADH-Free Wixsite" > 
  <p id="galtxt"> This is ADH-Free, a prototype mobile application intended for assisting people with ADHD. The project was made with the Seton High School INTERalliance as part of the December monthly chapter competition, themed with Medical Technology. We won first place for the project.<a href="https://meesek8.wixsite.com/adh-free">This link</a> will lead you to the website, currently under the ownership of the club teacher moderator. My part on the project included the website development and prototype development, where I used a Google Slides with buttons to simulate the appearence of an interractive app.</p>

  <h2> Experiences </h2>
  <h3 id="exphead"> August 2020 - May 2024: Setion High School INTERalliance</h3>
  <p id="exptxt"> My experiences with the Seton High School INTERalliance started freshman year when the club was struggling due to Covid-19 restrictions on social activities. I persisted with the club throughout its low peak in participation during my Sophomore year, and for my Junior year, some seniors and I took to reviving the club. With me as the secretary, we participated in chapter competitions, winning second place in our first one of web design. We also attended the 2023 TechOlympics as a chapter. For my Senior year, I was nominated and unaminously elected president. We participated in four total competitions including the 2024 TechOlympics. In all, we placed first for our prototype ADHD-assistance app <a href="https://meesek8.wixsite.com/adh-free">"ADH-Free"</a> and second in our educational video game "Cat Math" (link pending). For our efforts, we won Chapter of the Year and were the chapter with the most participation.</p>
  <h3 id="exphead">August 2022 - May 2023: University of Cincinnati CCP Engineering</h3>
  <p id="exptxt"> I took and passed both ENED 1100 and ENED 1120 as a junior in highschool, earning college credit and contributing to my college GPA. Skills from the course included LEGO robotics, Matlab, Excel, Python, Spatial Visulization, math with Related Rates, Statistics, and more. I completed the courses with an A in each.</p>
  <h3 id="exphead">February 2023: TechOlympics</h3>
  <p id="exptxt"> I attended TechOlympics: Electrify at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati, Ohio. The event was hosted by the INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati, where at the time I was the secretary of the Seton High School chapter. At TechOlympics, I had the opportunites to network with professionals from many prominent Cincinnati-based companies and learn different coding skills. I attended many seminars, including an information session promoting Girls Who Code, a class for introductory-level JavaScript, and how to further advance myself in my networking skills. </p>
  <h3 id="exphead"> June-July 2023: Girls Who Code Summer Self-Paced Program </h3>
  <p id="exptxt"> I participated in the HTML and CSS course in which I had coded this website. I am a proud Alumni of the Girls Who Code program.</p>
  <h3 id="exphead">Fall 2024: College Courses</h3>
  <p id="exptxt"> Acheiving a 4.0 GPA in my first college semester, I took STEM courses including Intro to Computer Science, a course on C++ programming, and Information Security and Assurance. I also took Linear Algebra, which advanced my skill in MatLab calculating.
    <h3 id="exphead">Spring 2024: Current College Courses</h3>
    <p id="exptxt">I am currently taking four computer science courses, inlcuding Data Structures, Introduction to Computer Systems, Discrete Structures, and Python Programming. Beyond CS classes I am taking Personal Development/Intro to CO-OP and Statistics, which is an asynchronous course. </p>
<h3 id="exphead">2024 - Present: College Extracurriculars</h3>
  <p id="exptxt"> EnableUC: As a member of the Lab Management Team, I have been trained in 3D printer maitenance including both software and hardware fixes. The team is responsible for helping our prosthetic design teams print efficiently and effectively.</p>
  <p id="exptxt"> Pride in Engineering: Member </p>
  <p id="exptxt"> Clean Up Cincy: Member</p>
  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p id="exptxt"> I am currently looking for a CO-OP position in the Summer 2025 semester focusing on software development and/or software engineering.  </p>
